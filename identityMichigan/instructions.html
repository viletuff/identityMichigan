    You've indicated that you have a felony offense on record, unfortunately this may delay or prevent you from changing your Legal Name.

                    On <strong>page 3</strong>, fill reason for not wanting to publish. Michigan Legal Help suggests <strong>"Public notice of this proceeding would reveal to the public that I am a transgender person. Transgender individuals often face pervasive discrimination in multiple parts of their lives, including in employment and housing. Data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey shows that nationally, 19% of transgender people reported being fired, not hired, or denied a promotion in the past year because they were transgender. 23% indicated they experienced housing discrimination in the past year (2015 U.S. Transgender Survey). I request that you keep this name change proceedings confidential to avoid public disclosure of transgender status which I fear, and the data shows, would likely result in me experiencing discrimination and harassment."</strong> Note that this it is not a guarantee and ultimately it is up to the judge and if they feel like being a jerk.

             As of <strong>January of 2025</strong>, it is currently unclear if Gender Marker change is possible for any Federal Documents. Before attempting, I would recommend calling your <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp">local Social Security Office</a> and asking.
